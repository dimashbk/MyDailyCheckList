# Welcome to MyDailyCheckList app

## Task
  Obviously it is the simple ToDo manager. May be further I will add some new options and etc.
  So there is no UI/UX design only the business-logic.
  





## Description
  I have used MVC pattern. I've tried to make it clean as you can notice.
  I have used UserDefaults to save the tasks and settings for the task.
  Finally i have made my first app.

## Usage
  You have the main scene where you will have + button it will add the tasks that you have to do.
  This button will move you to Edit View Controller where as you've already understood you will set your settings. 
  Touch the task will make it completed
  Swipe to the left will delete the task
  Swipe to the right will edit completed to uncompleted
  Also you have Edit button where you will be able to move/delete the tasks
